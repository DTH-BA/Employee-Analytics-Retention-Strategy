# Employee Analytics & Retention Strategy 📊

This project simulates a real-world HR business case in which data is used to inform executive decisions on employee retention, salary fairness, and performance-based compensation. The goal is to help HR leaders make strategic decisions based on data-driven insights.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Analyze salary distribution across departments, gender, and race
- Identify pay fairness and role-level disparities
- Evaluate the effectiveness of performance-based pay
- Detect turnover risks among high-performing employees
- Provide actionable HR recommendations to support the 2025 workforce strategy

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Source:** HRDataset_v14.csv ([anonymized internal HR dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set))

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Production department has multiple high-performing employees with low satisfaction and high absenteeism → retention risk.
- Gender is fairly distributed, but women are concentrated in lower-paying departments.
- Performance-based pay is well-aligned, but not sufficient alone to retain top performers.
- Salary disparities exist within the same roles → need for internal equity review.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Conduct internal salary equity audits
- Offer retention bonuses or development pathways to top performers
- Launch mentoring programs to support underrepresented groups in high-paying roles
- Sustain performance-based pay with added non-financial incentives and recognition
- Conduct stay interviews to reduce silent attrition
